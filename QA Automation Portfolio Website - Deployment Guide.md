# QA Automation Portfolio Website - Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying your QA Automation portfolio website. The website has been fully built and is ready for deployment. You have two recommended options for hosting your site with a free domain:

1. GitHub Pages (recommended for simplicity)
2. Vercel (recommended for additional features)

Both options provide:
- Free hosting with no time limit
- Custom domain support
- Global CDN for fast loading
- HTTPS security

## Files Included

- `portfolio-deployment.zip` - Contains all the built files ready for deployment
- `github-pages-instructions.md` - Step-by-step guide for GitHub Pages deployment
- `vercel-instructions.md` - Step-by-step guide for Vercel deployment

## Quick Start

1. Extract `portfolio-deployment.zip` to access the built website files
2. Choose your preferred deployment platform (GitHub Pages or Vercel)
3. Follow the corresponding instruction file

## Website Features

Your portfolio website includes:
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Modern UI inspired by brittanychiang.com but customized for QA Automation
- Sections for your work experience, projects, skills, and certifications
- Clean, professional design with animations and transitions

## Customization

If you need to make changes to the website content after deployment:
1. For minor text changes, you can edit the HTML files directly
2. For major changes, you may need to modify the source code and rebuild

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment, both GitHub and Vercel offer extensive documentation and community support.

## Future Maintenance

Your website will remain online indefinitely as long as your GitHub/Vercel account remains active. To update your site in the future, simply upload new files using the same process.

Enjoy your new portfolio website!
